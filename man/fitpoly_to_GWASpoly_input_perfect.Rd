\title{Function takes the output from compare_probes() and prepares it for input to use in GWASpoly.
Function reads in annotation files and matches the genome position of Rosa chinensis genome (Hibrand-Saint Oyant et al., 2018)
NOTE: must be connected to internet to read in annotation files}
\usage{
fitpoly_to_GWASpoly_input_perfect(input_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_file}{is a .csv file that has the dosages and Axiom marker names. Most likely an output file of compare_probes() function}
}
\value{
a .csv file that has the added columns of genome position and LG of markers. Will contain markers with no known location at bottom of file.
